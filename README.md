# Best practices for GeoPackage encodings
This repository gathers best practices for GeoPackage encodings of INSPIRE datasets. The issue tracker serves as a place to discuss all kinds of issues with GeoPackage files and the GeoPackage specification.

## Background
On the 63rd MIG-meeting, it was decided to establish an ad-hoc group to facilitate discussions on GeoPackage encodings, see the [minutes of that meeting](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=559350289).

## Relations to other actions
The work done here is related to what has been done on alternative encodings, see https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/2017.2.
