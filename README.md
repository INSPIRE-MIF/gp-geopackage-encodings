# Best practices for GeoPackage encodings
This repository gathers best practices for GeoPackage encodings of INSPIRE datasets. The issue tracker serves as a place to discuss all kinds of issues with GeoPackage files and the GeoPackage specification.<br>
Contributions to this repository supported the proposed Good Practice for the GeoPackage encoding of INSPIRE datasets, whose specifications are made available [here](/spec/GeoPackage_Good_Practice_initiation_fiche.md).<br>

## Background
On the 63rd MIG-T meeting, it was decided to establish an ad-hoc group to facilitate discussions on GeoPackage encodings and to support the development of a  proposal for the GeoPackage encoding of INSPIRE datasets as a candidate Good Practice - see the [minutes of that meeting](https://wikis.ec.europa.eu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=33528069).<br>
On the 69th MIG-T meeting, the "_GeoPackage encoding of INSPIRE datasets_" was accepted as good practice candidate. The initiation fiche is available [here](/spec/GeoPackage_Good_Practice_initiation_fiche.md).<br>
Following the [procedure for proposing and endorsing good practices](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/portfolio/good-practice-library), a GeoPackage and implementation practice outreach webinar was held on October 27, 2022. Links to webinar recording and presentations can be found [here](https://knowledge-base.inspire.ec.europa.eu/events/inspire-good-practice-geopackage-and-implementation-practice-webinar-2022-10-27_en).

On the 16th back to back MIG and MIG-T meeting on 24 and 25 November 2022, the "_GeoPackage encoding of INSPIRE datasets_" was unanimously endorsed as INSPIRE Good Practice - see the [minutes of that meeting](https://wikis.ec.europa.eu/display/InspireMIG/72nd+MIG-T+meeting+2022-11-25). 

## Relations to other actions
The work done here is related to what has been done on alternative encodings, see https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/2017.2.

## Examples
Some examples of GeoPackage files that are currently provided by member states are listed on [this page](/examples/overview.md).
